# Control and Model Identification
## Introduction

The experiment is about doing system identification of the inverted pendulum and designing the corresponding controller. In addition, we further deal with the motor dead zone by completing several experiments on the system.

## System Identification
### Problem:
We considered first and second order model to fit our system. We wanted to construct all of the models corresponding to several situations as shown in the picture.

However, as long we tried several experiments, the results are inconsistent with the first and second order model. To solve the problem, we implemented dead-zone identification as mentioned below.

### Solution: Dead Zone Identification
