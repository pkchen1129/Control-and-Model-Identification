# Control and Model Identification
## Introduction

The experiment is about doing system identification of the inverted pendulum and designing the corresponding controller. In addition, we further deal with the motor dead zone by completing several experiments on the system.

## System Identification
### Problem:
We considered first and second order model to fit our system. However, as long we tried several experiments and 

### Solution: Dead Zone Identification
